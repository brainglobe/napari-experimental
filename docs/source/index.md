`napari-experimental` is a project that allows for experimental implementation of non-core napari features, separate from the napari codebase.

At present, the project provides the following plugins:

## Contributing

We follow the same [contribution guidelines](https://napari.org/stable/developers/index.html) as the napari project.
Contributions are welcome to any of the plugins via pull request, and will be subject to review from appropriate maintainers.
